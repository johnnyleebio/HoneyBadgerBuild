        <p>Esper saves time for professionals. Our scheduling solution streamlines communication, automates tasks, and provides real context for executives before important meetings. Our goal is to make Esper to executive assistants what SalesForce is to salespeople.</p>

				<h1>Working with us:</h1>
				<p><span class="bold">We’re a startup.</span> Startups, by their nature, are based on speed and effort. You will not have a “typical” job - no 9 to 5, no stupid meetings, no layers, and no TPS reports. Our team works hard. But if you enjoy your work, team trips, and great food, it’s not really work. We have some advantages on our side - funding from top-tier investors, a proven team, a strong technical foundation, design sense (not limited to consumer phones) and a <a href="http://esper.com/img/4.jpg">spirit animal</a>. Honestly though, if you’re not interested in the startup ride, then you should stop reading here.</p>
        <br/ >

        <p><span class="bold">We’re a proud functional programming (i.e. <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a>) company.</span> Picture a world where multi-gear bikes were first invented and then because certain materials were in short supply, we switched to fixed gear bikes. As a result, most technology teams use the legacy standard, not because it’s better, but because it’s more known. We think the time is now for great companies to use functional programming languages (<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3026758/inside-erlang-the-rare-programming-language-behind-whatsapps-success">some already do</a>) and start <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">beating the averages</a>. Companies can support millions of users with a small team of first-class engineers by using a statically typed functional programming language like OCaml. We know we’re in the minority, but it’s elegant, speedy, and serves our purposes like a European racing bike. <span class="bold">We’re not zealots though, we also use javascript, java, and Obj-C - we believe in the right tool for the right job.</span></p>
        <br/ >
        
        <p><span class="bold">We are inquisitive.</span> We enjoy being in that phase of our lives where everything is still funny and magical. Lunch conversations include math, science, museums, model airplanes, animals, monsters, musicals, movies, and space. We are collaborative and quick on our feet and in our minds, grabbing solutions out of what might seem like thin air. Outwardly, we are engineers, designers, and product people. Inwardly, we could be airplane designers, mountain climbers, renowned singers, power cyclists, or any number of extraordinary beings - not to offend the ninjas, jedis, or superheroes dreamed up by job board creators.</p>
        <br/ >

        <p><span class="bold">We believe healthy people work better.</span> Esper has standing desks, team hikes, healthy snacks (nuts will make you live longer), and discussions about circadian rhythm, to name a few. We are always updating our workplace to create a healthy environment. Like other startups, we work long hours, cater lunch/dinner, but we make sure to have flexibility for employees and provide full healthcare, vision and dental coverage.</p>
        <br/ >

        <p><span class="bold">Oh, and you get an assistant.</span> We use our own solutions because we believe it makes the workforce more productive. No more dying the death of a thousand cuts. You get to focus on the things you do best and really enjoy your free time.</p>
        <br/ >

        <p>Last thing. Remember the joy of solving, building, and creating- like legos or paper airplanes? <span class="bold">Above all things, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow.</a></span></p>
        <br/ >

        <h3>Internships</h3>

        <p>Interns at Esper are constantly moving forward. Our interns touch every part of Esper’s business, because we believe in them. Google will be your friend as you work on growing our beta-user list, developing our website, designing our product, championing our marketing efforts, and ensuring Esper is on stable financial ground. Sound daunting? Good. At Esper, we’re about learning and iterating and learning and iterating.</p>
        
	<p>Our internships are unpaid, but we’ll give you lunch and dinner every day, a lot of responsibility, and fun (our team recently took a trip to hike Half Dome in Yosemite <a href=https://www.facebook.com/nicholasy.chen/media_set?set=a.10202985652256387.1073741834.1056600010&type=1>check out our pictures!</a>).You’ll be given guidance, but expected to execute on tasks independently. You’re talented and we’ll treat you as such. Great at fetching coffee and copying papers? Consider those skills mastered because we’ll never ask you to do either.</p>
        <p>Esper is a place where you will develop skills and juggle projects. Check out more about us at <a href=http://esper.com/aboutus.html>esper.com/aboutus.</a> For more information or to apply, contact <a href= mailto:mackenzie@esper.com>mackenzie@esper.com</a></p>
         <span class="bold">For applicants with CS experience:</span> 
        <p>Have experience with coding? Even better. We have a backlog of crazy, interesting ideas... but we have to fix bugs. You would work with a team member to rapidly prototype a new feature, ship it out to our users, and gain valuable experience working with a new language and platform.</p>
        <p>For more information or to apply, contact <a href=mailto:mackenzie@esper.com>mackenzie@esper.com</a></p>
