  			Esper Technologies' products, including but not limited to Esper.com and Esper Mobile (together and with other Esper Technologies products which may be developed in the future "Products"), is operated and presented to users by Esper Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Esper").  This Privacy Policy covers use of information collected by the Company.
				<br /><br />
				Esper is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.  Should Esper ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using Esper's Products and Services (as defined below), then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
				<br /><br />
				This Privacy Policy only covers information provided in connection with the Esper website, Products and Services.  The Esper website may contain links to other, unrelated websites.  Once you have used these links to leave the Esper website, we have no control over and are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you may disclose or which is obtained by visiting such websites.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">WHAT WE COLLECT</span>
				<br /><br />
				When purchasing a Product or registering a Product, we require you to provide us with certain personal contact information including name, company name, job title, address, post codes, phone number and email address ("Required Contact Information").  When purchasing a Product or signing up for continuing services offered as part of the Product or through the Esper website (collectively "Services"), we may require you to provide certain financial information including credit or debit card information, billing name and address, the number of employees who will be using the Product or Services, and other information as may be necessary to complete the purchase transaction ("Financial Information").  We may also ask you to provide other additional geographic or demographic information including preferences, interests, the total number of employees, company annual revenues, industry, and other information relevant to customer surveys and offers ("Demographic Information").  Required Contact Information, Financial Information and Demographic Information are referred to collectively as "Customer Information".
				<br /><br />
				Esper also tracks user emails and the email contact information of persons when contact is initiated by a Products and Services user through Esper Products and Services.
				<br /><br />
				While using the Products or Services Esper may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information gathering tools such as cookies ("Internet Gathered Information").  Internet Gathered Information will be more fully discussed below in Section III.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</span>
				<br /><br />
				Except as set forth in Esper's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, Esper employees are prohibited from viewing the Customer Information and content created through Esper Products and Services.  If you contact Esper for additional information or for help in resolving technical issues, Esper employees may access relevant data after receiving your permission.
				<br /><br />
				In addition to using the Customer Information in connection with the Products and Services, Esper also uses Customer Information to understand your needs and to better tailor the Products and Services, to develop or improve future functionality of the Products and Services, and to customize the Esper website according to your preferences.  Additionally, Esper may use the Customer Information for its own internal record keeping and product development.  Esper tracks email contact information of persons contacted through the Products and Services solely for routing purposes.
				<br /><br />
				If you use the "Contact Us" link on the Esper website, Esper will use the information provided to contact you about the Products or Services.  Esper may also contact you about your account or any of the Products or Services to which you subscribe.
				<br /><br />
				Esper may periodically send promotional emails, special offers or information about products which we think may be of interest to you.  For example, Esper may contact you to further discuss your interest in the Products and Services and to send you information about Esper, its partners, its affiliates, and information about promotions or events.  Additionally, Esper may also contact you for market research purposes.  You will have the opportunity to opt-out of such promotional and market research communications.
				<br /><br />
				The Financial Information is used solely to assess the financial qualifications of potential users and to collect payments for the purchase of any Products and Services.  Esper uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing on Esper's behalf.
				<br /><br />
				The Internet Gathered Information is used to operate and improve Esper's website, Products and Services.  The Internet Gathered Information may also be used alone or in conjunction with Customer Information to provide you with personalized information about Esper Products and Services.
				<br /><br />
				We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to data processors who act on our behalf (service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our website and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose).  To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose Customer Information in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.
				<br /><br />
				If Esper sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Esper may transfer Customer Information to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
				<br /><br />
				Except as stated within this Privacy Policy, Esper will never rent, sell or otherwise make Customer Information available to any third parties.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">COOKIES</span>
				<br /><br />
				A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.  Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site.  Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.  Esper tracks cookies as part of the Internet Gathered Information.
				<br /><br />
				Esper's website, Products and Services may be tailored to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering Internet Gathered Information and Customer Information.
				<br /><br />
				Esper uses traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.  We may then analyze data about web page traffic and improve the Esper website and tailor it to individual customer needs.  Esper only uses the Internet Gathered Information for statistical analysis purposes; the Internet Gather Information is removed from Esper's servers once the analysis is completed.
				<br /><br />
				Overall, the Internet Gathered Information helps Esper provide you with better Products and Services by enabling us to monitor which web pages are visited the most.  A cookie does not give Esper access to your computer or any information about you other than the data you choose to share with Esper.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you may modify your browser features to decline cookies.  If cookies are declined, you may not have full access to the Esper website, Products or Services.
				<br /><br />
				Esper may also collect information about your Internet Protocol ("IP") address to track and aggregate non-personal information.  For example, Esper may use IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate Esper's website.  IP addresses may also be used to confirm a customer's identity when the customer uses the Esper website, Products and Services.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">SECURITY</span>
				<br /><br />
				We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
				<br /><br />
				You may choose to restrict the collection or use of Customer Information.  If you have previously agreed to Esper using your Customer Information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to us at Esper, Inc., 435 Tasso Street, Suite 315, Palo Alto, CA 94301 or emailing us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@esper.com">customerservice@esper.com</a>.
				<br /><br />
				Esper will not sell, distribute or lease your Customer Information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law.  Esper may use your Required Contact Information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting.  You may opt out of receiving these promotional communications by writing to us at Esper, Inc., 435 Tasso Street, Suite 315, Palo Alto, CA 94301 or by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of Esper's marketing emails.
				<br /><br />
				You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your Customer Information controlled by Esper, (2) change or remove your Customer Information, and (3) terminate the Services associated with your account.  Please contact Esper at Esper, Inc., 435 Tasso Street, Suite 315, Palo Alto, CA 94301 or email us at  <a href="mailto:customerservice@esper.com">customerservice@esper.com</a> if you would like to access the Customer Information that we have collected online from you, correct factual errors in such information, request to have this information deleted, or request that we no longer collect or maintain such information.  Esper will respond to such request within 30 days.  Esper may charge a nominal fee for the time necessary to respond to such request.  The deletion of Customer Information may lead to a deauthorization of the Product or termination of the Services.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">CUSTOMER INFORMATION RETENTION</span>
				<br /><br />
				Esper retains the Customer Information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed for the Products and Services.  Esper may retain your Customer Information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.  Esper may retain Customer Information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement.  In addition to retaining Customer Information as set forth herein, Esper's Customer Service may retain Customer Information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis, but Esper will use reasonable efforts resolve Customer Support issues and trend analyses such that Customer Information may be deleted within 30 days of such written request.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">DISCLOSURE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</span>
				<br /><br />
				California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who are California residents to request and obtain from Esper a list of what personal information, if any, we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties.  Requests may be made once per year and are free of charge.  Under Section 1798.83 Esper currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</span>
				<br /><br />
				The Privacy Policy is effective as of January 27, 2014, and applies to all information previously obtained by Esper.  Esper reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy at its sole discretion.  Esper users will be informed of any such change by Esper posting a new privacy policy on the Esper website and the effective date of any change of Privacy Policy will be clearly marked.  Continued use of Esper Services or Products after Esper has published a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you consent to the changes.  As required by law, Esper will not use collected information in ways that are materially different from the ones described in this Privacy Policy without also providing notification of such practices and obtaining consent to any such different uses.
