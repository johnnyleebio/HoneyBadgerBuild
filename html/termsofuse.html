				<br /><br />
				Welcome to Esper.com (the "Site"). The Site, along with Esper Products and Services, is operated and presented to users by Esper Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Esper").  Esper may also be referred to herein as "we", "us" or "our".
				<br /><br />
				<span class="bold">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SITE.</span> By using the Esper Products or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to these terms, you signify your agreement to these Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to these documents, you may not use the Esper Products.  Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning as used in the Esper Technologies, Inc. <a href="http://www.Esper.com/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
				<br /><br />
				Note that special terms may apply to some services offered on the Site or as part of the Products or Services (as defined in the Esper Privacy Policy) provided by Esper (collectively "Esper Products").  Some Esper Products may have additional terms of use included within a separate license or user agreement.  Subject to applicable law, any such terms are in addition to these Terms of Use, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these Terms of Use.
				<br /><br />
				You acknowledge that these terms of use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that such consideration includes your use of the Esper Products, and receipt of data, materials and information available at or through the Esper Products.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">USE OF CONTENT</span>
				<br /><br />
				The Esper Products are for your general and informational use only.  You may not use the Esper Products for commercial purposes not expressly set forth in these Terms of Use or in any way that is unlawful, or harms us or any other person or entity as determined in our sole discretion.  You may not link to any Esper Products without Esper's prior written consent.
				<br /><br />
				All information, materials, functions and other content- including Submissions- ("Content") contained within the Esper Products are our copyrighted property or the copyrighted property of our licensors or licensees.  All trademarks, slogans, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to us and/or our licensors or licensees.  We may change the Esper Products or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any reason.
				<br /><br />
				Except as we specifically agree in writing, no Content from the Esper Products may be used, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other than as part of the Esper Products, not even as part of a derivative work, except that where the Esper Products are configured to enable the download of particular Content, you may download one copy of such Content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to, and do not rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, copy (except to create a single copy for your own back-up purposes), or create any derivative works based on the Esper Products or the Content, in whole or in part, and (c) do not use the Content in an unlawful manner or in a manner that suggests an association with any of our Products, Services or brands.  Using our Content for any purpose not expressly agreed to by Esper, including but not limited to "re-mailing" or high-volume or automated use of the Esper Products or using any of our Content on any other website or networked computer environment, is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights and is strictly prohibited.

We do not transfer title to the Software to you.
				<br /><br />
				Except as permitted under applicable law, you may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, adapt it, or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.
				<br /><br />
				<span class="bold">YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL HAVE THE EFFECT OF TRANSFERRING THE OWNERSHIP OF ANY COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, SLOGANS, SERVICE MARKS, TRADE NAMES, TRADE DRESS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE Esper PRODUCTS OR CONTENT OR ANY PART THEREOF TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY NOR TO AUTHORIZE YOU TO CREATE DERIVATIVE WORKS BASED ON THE CONTENT.</span> You undertake not to do any act or thing which is inconsistent with or which is likely in any way to prejudice such title.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">LICENSES AND REPRESENTATIONS</span>
				<br /><br />
				You grant Esper a nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, unlimited, assignable, sublicenseable, fully paid up and royalty-free right to us to copy, prepare derivative works of, improve, distribute, publish, remove, retain, add, process, analyze, use and commercialize, in any way now known or in the future discovered, any information you provide, directly or indirectly to Esper, including, but not limited to, any user generated content, ideas, concepts, techniques and/or data to the services, you submit to Esper (collectively "Submissions"), without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties.  Any Submissions you submit to us is at your own risk of loss.  By providing Submissions to us, you represent and warrant that you are entitled to submit the information and that the information is accurate, not confidential, and not in violation of any contractual restrictions or other third party rights.  It is your responsibility to keep your Esper Customer Information (as defined in the Esper Privacy Policy) accurate and updated.  No rights are granted to you hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein.
				<br /><br />
				You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act which might be necessary to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these Terms of Use.
				<br /><br />
				You agree that any Submissions you make are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type.
				<br /><br />
				To the extent any "moral rights", "ancillary rights", or similar rights ("Moral Rights") in or to the Submissions exist and are not exclusively owned by us and to the extent you are able to do so under applicable law, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to us or our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to enforce from any others who may possess such rights.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">ACCOUNTS</span>
				<br /><br />
				Some features on the Site, Products and Services permit or require you to create an account to participate or to secure additional benefits.  You agree to provide, maintain and update true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration processes (the "Registration Data").  You agree to keep your account password secure and confidential.  You shall not impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or entity, including using another person's username, password or other account information, or another person's name, likeness, voice, image or photograph.  You acknowledge that you may not sublicense, transfer, sell, or assign your membership or account ID.  Any attempt to sublicense, transfer, auction, sell or assign the membership or account ID is void, and such attempts, regardless of whether made by account holder, will result in immediate termination of your account.
				<br /><br />
				You also agree to promptly notify us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@esper.com">customerservice@esper.com</a> of any unauthorized use of your username, password, other account information, or any other breach of security that you become aware of involving or relating to the Site, Products and Services.  You agree that you shall remain responsible for anything that happens through your account until you close down your account or prove that your account security was compromised due to no fault of your own.
				<br /><br />
				Subject to applicable law, Esper may suspend or terminate your account and your ability to use the Site, Products and Services or any portion thereof for failure to comply with these Terms of Use or any special terms related to a particular service, for infringing copyright, or for any other reason whatsoever.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">PAYMENT</span>
				<br /><br />
				If you purchase any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or subscription basis ("Premium Services"), you agree to Esper storing your payment information.  You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the Premium Services (including, without limitation, periodic fees for premium accounts) as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts.  Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription.  Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Esper does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment.
				<br /><br />
				If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your account or such Premium Service, you authorize us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.  Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription.  All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.  You may cancel or suspend your Premium Services by contacting us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@esper.com">customerservice@esper.com</a>.  Esper does not guarantee refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction.
				<br /><br /><br />

You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing Esper Products through your mobile access provider.  Therefore, you should check with your provider to find out if the Esper Products are available and the terms for these services for your specific mobile devices.

				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">AMENDMENT</span>
				<br /><br />
				Subject to applicable law, at any time, we may amend these Terms of Use (including by modification, deletion and/or addition of any portion thereof).  If we make a material amendment to these Terms of Use, we will notify you of such amendment by posting notice of such amendment on the Site.

				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">TERMINATION</span>
				<br /><br />
				These Terms of Use are effective until terminated by either you or us.

				<br /><br />
				We may immediately terminate these Terms of Use with respect to you, including your access to the Esper Products, in our absolute discretion including, without limitation, if you breach or fail to comply with any material term or provision of these Terms of Use.  Upon termination, you must cease use of the Esper Products and destroy all materials obtained from the Esper Products and all copies thereof, whether made under these Terms of Use or otherwise.

				<br /><br />
				These Terms of Use shall survive any termination.
				<br /><br /><br />
				<span class="bold">GENERAL PROVISIONS</span>
				<br /><br />
				Subject to the requirements of applicable consumer rights and other laws, these terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.  Except as expressly stated in these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use, together with the Esper Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning their subject matter.  If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  In these Terms of Use, the word "including" is used illustratively, as if followed by the words "but not limited to".  You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms of Use.  Esper may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under the Terms of Use, fully or partially, without notice to you.  No third party beneficiary rights are created by these Terms of Use.  In the event that litigation arises out of, relates to or concerns your use of the Esper Products or these terms of use, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all attorneys' fees and expenses, including any professionals' and expert fees.  <span class="bold">TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE ESPER PRODUCTS MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR (OR THE MINIMUM APPLICABLE STATUTORY PERIOD, IF LONGER) AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.</span>
